## 1.	How do I approach designing software?
    -What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        -This project has taught me to research. Since this a brand-new concept to me there was a major learning curve. I had to learn not only what and how the functions work but how to put it all together to make a cohesive design.
### o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
 The classic design process: define the task, collect all the information, analyze, study / repeat the previous two steps, then finally develop, and improve.
### o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This design approach is used for any of my coding projects. I find its best to have an outlined thought process where you can compartmentalize the issues and work on one thing at a time rather than become overwhelmed by the project as a whole.
# 2.	How do I approach developing programs?
## o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
### When working on a 3D scene I found it easier to duplicate my project and work in a separate debug instance. Then work on each shape at a time making sure it works exactly as intended then transplant either that code section or class into the main project.
## o	How did iteration factor into your development?
### I used iteration to create multiple pyramids which eventually formed my comb. The loop I used was a simple for loop.
## o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
### With every milestone we were given more information, as well as more examples of code. Each week I was able to dissect that code to see how certain functions or class work to create my own scene. 
# 3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
## o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
### Off the top of my head I can’t see an immediate need for this knowledge but with the way AI and virtually reality is progressing I can definitely see a need for some variation of graphic visualization in the future.
## o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
### In my current profession I don’t have much need for graphic visualizations outside of basic charts and graphic / UI elements. However, this class taught me a different very valuable lesson, how to dissect code and understand components to create something of my own.
